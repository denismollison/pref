Description: Runs election counts using the Single Transferable Vote with an emphasis on providing explanations of the results, particularly graphics incorporating explanatory comments. Uses Meek's STV algorithm (widely regarded as the optimal form of STV), in a form allowing equal preferences; or alternatively WIG (Weighted Inclusive Gregory) STV as used for Scottish Council elections and elsewhere. Provides a function to convert common vote data formats into a standard R list.
