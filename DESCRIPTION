Description: Implements the Single Transferable Vote (STV) electoral system, with
    clear explanatory graphics. The core function is Meek's method, the purest
    expression of the simple principles of STV, but which requires electronic
    counting. It can handle votes expressing equal preferences for subsets of
    the candidates. A function stv.wig implementing the Weighted Inclusive
    Gregory method, as used in Scottish council elections, is also provided,
    and with the same options, as described below. The required vote data format
    is as an R list: a function pref.data is provided to transform some commonly
    used data formats into this format.
