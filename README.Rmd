Preference voting

There's a full manual pref_pkg_manual.pdf

The goal of the function stv is to count votes from an STV election, together with clear explanatory graphics. Its core option is Meek STV, which is the purest expression of <a href="https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~denis/stv/">the simple principles of STV</a>, but requires electronic counting. It can handle votes expressing equal preference for some of the candidates.

You can install the development version of pref from Github
  ```r
# install.packages("devtools")
install_github("denismollison/pref")
  ```
  
Five examples are provided, drawn from real elections, hc12, p17, nws17, yale and j02.
Three are from Scottish Council elections, one a very simple case and the second a more usual one. The third example (nws17) is one where using the official counting method (stv.wig) no candidate achieves the fixed quota.
The fourth, from a Yale faculty election, is an example with a large number of candidates (44 for 4 places). A simplified version, showing just the later stages of this election is provided as y12.

The final example, j02, is from a charity's trustees election in which equal preferences were allowed.

To run the first of these:
  ```r
# library(pref)
hc12c=stv(hc12)
  ```

This code produces a list of variables summarising the count and final outcome. With the default options `verbose=T' and `plot=T' it also produces graphics as the count progresses, and embeds these in web pages when it finishes. The directory for the web pages can be specified by `outdirec=directory'; the default is to write them to a temporary directory.
